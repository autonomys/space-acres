    Space Acres is an opinionated GUI application for farming on Autonomys Network.

    Before continuing you need 3 things:
    ✔ Wallet address where you'll receive rewards (use Subwallet, polkadot{"{"}.js{"}"} extension or any other wallet compatible with Substrate chain)
    ✔ 100G of space on a good quality SSD to store node data
    ✔ any SSDs (or multiple) with as much space as you can afford for farming purposes, this is what will generate rewards

upgrade_title = Upgrade
upgrade_message =
    Thanks for choosing Space Acres again!

    The chain you were running before upgrade is no longer compatible with this release of Space Acres, likely because you were participating in the previous version of Autonomys.

    But fear not, you can upgrade to currently supported network with a single click of a button!
